Recommendations for Best Usage:
1.	Multifamily Townhouses (Current Plan):
o	Strengths: Already aligns with zoning requirements, approved design, and community need for housing in growing urban areas.
o	Potential Expansion: The current plan utilizes three units but exploring the FAR may allow for additional units or features like rooftop amenities, especially if the lot’s size supports it.
2.	Alternative Multifamily Options:
o	Consider rowhouses or stacked apartments for higher density if the lot can accommodate more units under FAR regulations. These options might better utilize the space and align with urban housing demands.
3.	Green and Affordable Housing:
o	Leverage green incentives to add features like solar panels or green roofs. Additionally, participating in affordable housing initiatives could provide financial and zoning benefits.
4.	Community Engagement Features:
o	Incorporate shared spaces or community gardens to improve resident engagement and attractiveness to renters or buyers.
5.	Resale Value Optimization:
o	Focus on high-demand designs such as modern townhomes with energy-efficient certifications, which are attractive in Seattle’s market.
