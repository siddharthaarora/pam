# The Naive Approach to RAG Workflow

Let's review what we've been doing repeatedly in the last several lessons to drive the point home.

1. 📚 **Indexing**: Here's you're processing raw data into manageable, searchable chunks and indexing them for efficient retrieval. Good indexing organizes the data to facilitate quick and accurate retrieval based on user queries.

2. 🔍 **Retrieval**: When a user submits a query, the retrieval stage uses the query to search the indexed data and fetch the most relevant information. The effectiveness of this stage depends on the quality of the indexing and the relevance of the retrieved data to the user's query.

3. 🖊️ **Generation**: In the final stage, the original user query is combined with the retrieved data to generate a comprehensive, context-aware response. The generation process synthesizes the retrieved context into the response while maintaining coherence and relevance.

## Challenges in the Naive RAG Approach

While the naive RAG workflow provides a foundation for enhancing LLMs with external knowledge, it also presents several challenges:

1. 🚧 **Indexing Issues**

   - ❌ Incomplete or inaccurate information extraction during the indexing process.

   - 🧩 Suboptimal chunking of data, leading to inefficient retrieval.

   - 🐌 Inefficient indexing techniques that hinder quick and accurate retrieval.

   - 🤔 Poor semantic representation of the indexed data, limiting understanding of its meaning and context.

2. 🚨 **Retrieval Difficulties**

   - **Low Precision:** Not all retrieved data matches the query, leading to potential errors and inaccuracies. 

   - **Low Recall:** Failure to retrieve all relevant data limits the context available for response generation.

   - Users query effectiveness in fetching the most appropriate information.

   - Retrieval of redundant or overlapping information, leading to inefficient use of computational resources.

3. ⚠️ **Generation Problems**

  - **Hallucination:** The model may generate fictitious responses not grounded in retrieved data, or poor merging of retrieved data can result in incoherent or disjointed outputs.

   - Hard to ascertain the relative relevance of retrieved context for the generation task.

   - Risk of overly relying on external information, or merely echo the retrieved data without adding new insights, leading to responses that lack originality or fail to capture the nuances of the user's query.

   - Potential for generating biased, inconsistent, or irrelevant responses due to the limitations of the retrieved data or the generation process itself.

These challenges must be addressed to build sophisticated and reliable RAG systems that can effectively leverage external knowledge to enhance the performance of language models.

We'll learn how to improve upon Naive RAG with more advanced and modular methods, but first, we need to understand how to evaluate our system to measure improvements to it.
