    "# A brief word on vector store query modes\n",
    "\n",
    "The `vector_store_query_mode` in LlamaIndex determines the type of search to be performed. Here's a brief description of each mode:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `default`: This mode performs a vector search. It retrieves the most similar vectors based on the query vector.  They create a numerical representation of a piece of text, represented as a long list of numbers. These dense vectors can capture rich semantics across the entire piece of text. `alpha=0.75` is used by default.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `hybrid`: This mode performs a hybrid search. It combines vector search with traditional search methods. `alpha` parameter determines weighting (`alpha = 0` -> bm25, `alpha = 1` -> vector search). \n",
    "\n",
    " - `semantic_hybrid`: Semantic hybrid search combines text search with vector embeddings. Text search provides keyword matching and lexical retrieval. Vector embeddings allow finding documents with similar meaning, even if they don't contain exact keyword matches. This mode incorporates semantic reranking to hybrid search results to improve search relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `sparse`: Most of the elements in a sparse vector are zero, with only a few key values being non-zero. These sparse vectors are great at capturing specific keywords and similar small details. You need to use a specialized embedding model to create sparse vectors. \n",
    "   - `FastEmbed` has a few choices for sparse text embedding models, for example you can pass in `prithvida/Splade_PP_en_v1` as the model name when you run `setup_embed_model` if you want to use them. \n",
    "    - We didn't use a sparse vector here, so we won't see this in action.  \n",
    "    - Note, if you try this you'll need to set the `sparse_top_k` argument, which represents how many nodes will be retrieved from each dense and sparse query. For example, if `sparse_top_k=5` is set, that means I will retrieve 5 nodes using sparse vectors and 5 nodes using dense vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `text_search`: Text search looks for exact keyword matches between the query and documents.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `similarity_top_k`: controls the final number of returned nodes. A fusion algorithm is applied to rank and order the nodes from different vector spaces, `similarity_top_k=2` means the top two nodes after fusion are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `hybrid_top_k`: return top k results from `hybrid` search. `similarity_top_k` is used for dense search top k"

    "# Hybrid Fusion Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hybrid Fusion Retriever combines of semantic and keyword-based approaches.  This uses a [BM25-based retriever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) with a semantic index. [BM25](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/llama-index-integrations/retrievers/llama-index-retrievers-bm25/llama_index/retrievers/bm25/base.py) is a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "The system follows a three-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query Generation/Rewriting**: It creates multiple queries from the original user query to better match the user's intent and improve the precision and recall of the retrieved results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieval**: It performs the retrieval for each query over an ensemble of retrievers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reranking/Fusion**: It combines the results from all queries and applies a reranking step to fuse the top relevant results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ℹ️ Useful knowledge to have as a RAG practitioner\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Index Fusion Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "We set the mode to `reciprocal_rerank`. The system merges its index with a BM25 based retriever. This allows it to understand both the semantic relationships (meaningful connections between words) and keywords in the input queries. Other modes are `relative_score`, `dist_based_score`, `simple` .\n",
    "\n",
    "  - [`reciprocal_rerank`](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/f116d75557d6867ed2cc61811a1c2f0b0c4d4ddb/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/retrievers/fusion_retriever.py#L99): Reciprocal rank is a measure of how early a relevant item appears in a ranked list. Lower ranks correspond to higher relevance. This mode fuses the results from multiple sources by giving higher importance to nodes that appear earlier in the rankings across those sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - [`relative_score`](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/f116d75557d6867ed2cc61811a1c2f0b0c4d4ddb/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/retrievers/fusion_retriever.py#L135): It scales each score to a range from 0 to 1 using min-max scaling. Then it multiplies each scaled score by a retriever-specific weight. After that, it divides each score by the total number of queries. Basically, it scales, weights, and combines scores from multiple retrieval sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `dist_based_score`: Same as `relative_score`, but, instead of using the minimum and maximum scores directly, the function calculates them based on the mean and standard deviation of the scores. This reduces the impact of outliers on the scaling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `simple`: re-orders results based on original scores\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **[Reciprocal Rerank Algorithm](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf)**\n",
    "\n",
    " Since both retrievers calculate a score for the relevance of results, the system uses the reciprocal rerank algorithm to reshuffle the results. This is done without employing additional models or excessive computation, making the process more efficient.\n",
    " \n",
    "  - 🧮 **Rank Calculation**: For each unique node, calculate its reciprocal rank from each list where it appears. The reciprocal rank of a node in a list is defined as 1 divided by its position in that list (e.g., a node at rank 3 has a reciprocal rank of 1/3).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - 📊 **Score Aggregation**: Sum up the reciprocal ranks for each node across all lists in which it appears. This aggregated score represents the overall relevance of the node, taking into account its performance across multiple retrieval scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - 🥇🥈🥉 **Reordering**: Finally, reorder all nodes based on their aggregated scores, from highest to lowest. This re-ranking step prioritizes nodes that consistently appear in higher ranks across multiple lists, thus likely to be more relevant to the query."

I just want to be the most successful version of myself while working the least hard possible. I want to live in a way that if my life played out 1,000 times, Naval is successful 999 times.

Engineers will work on sexy projects like ghter planes and moon rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs. Startups are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in the last couple decades. Since it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has used essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage, where measurement comes from working with a small group, and leverage from developing new techniques. The recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is in Santa Clara today. Understanding this may help to answer an important question: why Europe grew so powerful. Was it something about the geography of Europe? Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior? Was it their religion? The answer (or at least the proximate cause) may be that the Europeans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who made a lot of money to keep it. Once youre allowed to do that, people who want to get rich can do it by generating wealth instead of stealing it. The resulting technological growth translates not only into wealth but into military power. The theory that led to the stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician. But because the Soviet Union didnt have a computer industry, it remained for them a theory; they didnt have hardware capable of executing the calculations fast enough to design an actual airplane. In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as World War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history. Dont let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world....\n",
