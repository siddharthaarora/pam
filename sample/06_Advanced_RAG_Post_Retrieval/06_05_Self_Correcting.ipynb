    "# Self-Correcting Query Engines\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-correcting query engines in LlamaIndex evaluate their own output and then self-correct to provide better responses. They are designed to improve the quality of responses from a base query engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few types of self-correcting query engines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retry Query Engine:** This engine uses an evaluator to improve the response from a base query engine. It first queries the base query engine, then uses the evaluator to decide if the response passes. If the response passes, it returns the response. Otherwise, it transforms the original query with the evaluation result into a new query and repeats the process up to a maximum number of retries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retry Source Query Engine:** This engine modifies the query source nodes by filtering the existing source nodes for the query based on LLM node evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retry Guideline Query Engine:** This engine uses guidelines to direct the evaluator's behavior. It can be customized with your own guidelines. The engine evaluates the response against the guidelines, and if the response doesn't meet the guidelines, it transforms the query and retries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔃 [RetryQueryEngine](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/llama-index-core/llama_index/core/query_engine/retry_query_engine.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RetryQueryEngine` improves the quality of query responses by retrying the query if the initial response fails to meet certain evaluation criteria. It provides a way to automatically handle situations where the first attempt at answering a query may not produce a satisfactory result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind this class is that sometimes, the initial response generated by a query engine might not be accurate or comprehensive enough. By evaluating the response against predefined criteria and retrying the query with modifications if necessary, the `RetryQueryEngine` aims to iteratively improve the response until it meets the desired quality or until the maximum number of retries is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Arguments you need to know**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `query_engine`: The underlying query engine that will be used to execute the actual queries. You need to provide an initialized query engine object that is capable of handling the specific type of queries you want to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `evaluator`: Responsible for evaluating the quality of the query responses. The evaluator should have a method called `evaluate_response` that takes the query string and the response as input and returns an evaluation result indicating whether the response meets the desired criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `max_retries`: This is an integer value specifying the maximum number of retries allowed. It determines how many times the `RetryQueryEngine` will attempt to retry the query if the previous response fails evaluation. By default, it is set to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `callback_manager`: Manages callbacks during the query execution process. If you have any specific callbacks you want to register or invoke during the query lifecycle, you can provide a callback manager object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Under the hood**\n",
    "\n",
    "It iteratively queries the base query engine, evaluates the response, and if the response fails the evaluation, it transforms the query based on the feedback and retries the process until a satisfactory response is obtained or the maximum number of retries is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `RetryQueryEngine` first queries the base query engine (`query_engine`) with the original `QueryBundle` to obtain an initial response.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It then uses the `evaluator` to determine if the response passes the evaluation criteria. The `evaluate_response` method of the evaluator is called with the query string and the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the response passes the evaluation (i.e., `eval.passing` is `True`), the `RetryQueryEngine` immediately returns the response without any further retries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If the response fails the evaluation (i.e., `eval.passing` is `False`), the `RetryQueryEngine` transforms the original query using the `FeedbackQueryTransformation` class. The transformation takes into account the original query bundle, the response, and the evaluation feedback to create a new, modified query bundle.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The `RetryQueryEngine` then creates a new instance of itself with the same `query_engine`, `evaluator`, and decremented `max_retries`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The new, modified query bundle is passed to the `query` method of the newly created `RetryQueryEngine` instance, and the process repeats from step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The retries continue until either a satisfactory response is obtained (i.e., the evaluation passes) or the maximum number of retries (`max_retries`) is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The final response, whether it passed evaluation or reached the maximum retries, is returned.\n"
