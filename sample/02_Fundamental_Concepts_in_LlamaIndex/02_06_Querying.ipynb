    "- üìö **Retrieval**: Find and return the most relevant documents from the `Index` using strategies like \"top-k\" semantic retrieval.\n",

It behooves us therefore to find the good and to make the\\r\\nbest of the ill. Two men were falling from an aeroplane. \"I\\'ll bet you\\r\\nfive dollars,\" said one, \"that I hit the ground first.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    To take things as they be--\\r\\n    Thet\\'s my philosophy.\\r\\n  No use to holler, mope, or cuss--\\r\\n  If they was changed they might be wuss.\\r\\n\\r\\n    If rain is pourin\\' down,\\r\\n    An\\' lightnin\\' buzzin\\' roun\\',\\r\\n  I ain\\'t a-fearin\\' we\\'ll be hit,\\r\\n  But grin thet I ain\\'t out in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n    If I got deep in debt--\\r\\n    It hasn\\'t happened yet--\\r\\n  And owed a man two dollars, Gee!\\r\\n  Why I\\'d be glad it wasn\\'t three.\\r\\n\\r\\n    If some one come along,\\r\\n    And tried to do me wrong,\\r\\n  Why I should sort of take a whim\\r\\n  To thank the Lord I wasn\\'t him.\\r\\n\\r\\n    I never seen a night\\r\\n    So dark there wasn\\'t light\\r\\n  Somewheres about if I took care\\r\\n  To strike a match and find out where.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_John Kendrick Bangs._\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom \"Songs of Cheer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LIFE WITHOUT PASSION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA person may feel deeply without shouting his emotion to the skies, or\\r\\nbe strong without seizing occasions to exhibit his strength. In truth we\\r\\ndistrust the power which makes too much a display of itself. Let it\\r\\nexert itself only to the point of securing the ends that are really\\r\\nnecessary. Restraint, self-control are in truth more mighty than might\\r\\nunshackled, just as a self-possessed opponent is more dangerous than a\\r\\nfrenzied one. Moreover, there is a moral side to the question. A good\\r\\nquality, if abused or allowed free sway, becomes a force for evil and\\r\\ndoes its owner more harm than if he had not possessed it in the first\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  They that have power to hurt, and will do none,\\r\\n  That do not do the thing they most do show,\\r\\n  Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,\\r\\n  Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,--\\r\\n\\r\\n  They rightly do inherit heaven\\'s graces,\\r\\n  And husband nature\\'s riches from expense;\\r\\n  They are the lords and owners of their faces,\\r\\n  Others, but stewards of their excellence.\\r\\n\\r\\n  The summer\\'s flower is to the summer sweet,\\r\\n  Though to itself it only live and die;\\r\\n  But if that flower with base infection meet,\\r\\n  The basest weed outbraves his dignity:\\r\\n\\r\\n  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;\\r\\n  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_William Shakespeare._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHARACTER OF A HAPPY LIFE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'d rather be right than President,\" said Henry Clay. It is to men who\\r\\nare animated by this spirit that the greatest satisfaction in life\\r\\ncomes. For true blessedness does not lie far off and above us. It is\\r\\nclose at hand. Booker T. Washington once told a story of a ship that had\\r\\nexhausted its supply of fresh water and signaled its need to a passing\\r\\nvessel. The reply was, \"Send down your buckets where you are.\" Thinking\\r\\nthere was some misunderstanding, the captain repeated his signal, only\\r\\nto be answered as before. This time he did as he was bidden and secured\\r\\nan abundance of fresh water. His ship was opposite the mouth of a mighty\\r\\nriver which still kept its current unmingled with the waters of the\\r\\nocean.'"
