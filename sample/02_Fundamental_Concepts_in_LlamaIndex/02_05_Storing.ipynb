Slow, painful is the way,\\r\\n    And still, the bravest fight and conquer so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Miriam Teichner._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHOLD FAST\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA football coach who told his players that their rivals were too strong\\r\\nfor them would be seeking a new position the next year. If the opposing\\r\\nteam is formidable, he says so; if his men have their work cut out for\\r\\nthem, he admits it; but he mentions these things as incitements to\\r\\neffort. Merely saying of victory that it can be won is among the surest\\r\\nways of winning it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  When you\\'re nearly drowned in trouble, and the world is dark as ink;\\r\\n    When you feel yourself a-sinking \\'neath the strain,\\r\\n  And you think, \"I\\'ve got to holler \\'Help!\\'\" just take another breath\\r\\n    And pretend you\\'ve lost your voice--and can\\'t complain!\\r\\n      (That\\'s the idea!)\\r\\n    Pretend you\\'ve lost your voice and can\\'t complain!\\r\\n\\r\\n  When the future glowers at you like a threatening thunder cloud,\\r\\n    Just grit your teeth and bend your head and say:\\r\\n  \"It\\'s dark and disagreeable and I can\\'t help feeling blue,\\r\\n    But there\\'s coming sure as fate a brighter day!\"\\r\\n      (Say it slowly!)\\r\\n    \"But there\\'s coming sure as fate, a brighter day!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n  You have bluffed your way through ticklish situations; that I know.\\r\\n    You are looking back on troubles past and gone;\\r\\n  Now, turn the tables, and as you have fought and won before,\\r\\n    Just BLUFF YOURSELF to keep on holding on!\\r\\n      (Try it once.)\\r\\n  Just bluff YOURSELF to keep on--holding on.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Don\\'t worry if the roseate hues of life are faded out,\\r\\n    Bend low before the storm and wait awhile.\\r\\n  The pendulum is bound to swing again and you will find\\r\\n    That you have not forgotten how to smile.\\r\\n      (That\\'s the truth!)\\r\\n    That you have not forgotten how to smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Everard Jack Appleton._\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom \"The Quiet Courage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: JOHN KENDRICK BANGS]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWILL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren Hastings resolved in his boyhood that he would be the owner of\\r\\nthe estate known as Daylesford.
